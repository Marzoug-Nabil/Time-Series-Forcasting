# Time Series Forecasting with Xgboost

## Introduction

This repository contains a project on time series forecasting using Facebook Prophet. Facebook Prophet is an open-source forecasting tool built by Facebook's Core Data Science team, and it is designed to make time series forecasting accessible to non-experts. With its intuitive interface and powerful performance, Prophet has gained popularity in the data science community for forecasting various types of time series data.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Marzoug-Nabil/Time-Series-Forcasting.git
cd your-repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
## Contents
The repository is organized as follows:

Hourly_Energy_Consumption_Forecasting.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook showcasing examples of hourly energy consumption forecasting using XGBoost. It covers data preprocessing, model training, and visualization of the results.

data/: This directory contains the dataset used in the examples.

LICENSE: The license file for the project.

requirements.txt: A list of Python dependencies needed to run the Jupyter Notebook.

## Model evaluation
The XGBoost model's performance is evaluated using Root mean squared error (RMSE).

## Results and Interpretation
The forecasting results are presented in visualizations, comparing the actual energy consumption values with the model predictions. We interpret the accuracy of the model and identify any patterns or trends in the energy consumption data.
