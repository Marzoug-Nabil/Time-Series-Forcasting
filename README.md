# Time Series Forecasting with Xgboost

## Introduction

This repository contains a project on hourly energy consumption forecasting using XGBoost. XGBoost is an efficient and popular machine learning algorithm known for its high performance in regression and classification tasks. In this project, we explore how XGBoost can be utilized to forecast hourly energy consumption based on historical data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains hourly energy consumption data. The data includes features such as date, time, weather conditions, and previous energy consumption values.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Marzoug-Nabil/Time-Series-Forcasting.git
cd your-repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

requirements.txt: A list of Python dependencies needed to run the Jupyter Notebook.

## Model evaluation
The XGBoost model's performance is evaluated using Root mean squared error (RMSE).

## Results and Interpretation
The forecasting results are presented in visualizations, comparing the actual energy consumption values with the model predictions. We interpret the accuracy of the model and identify any patterns or trends in the energy consumption data.
